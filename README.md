# jquery-debouncedwidth

The debouncedwidth event combines two performance critical features:

- Reducing the amount of fired resize events
- Disable resize events for height changes

The second feature is especially useful to ignore height changes in mobile browsers
when the address bar hides or shows up while scrolling.

## Usage, Demo

Just include `jquery.debouncedwidth.min.js` after jQuery and use the `debouncedwidth`
event as a substitute for the ordinary `resize` event.

```javascript
$(window).on("debouncedwidth", function () {
  // your code
});
```

To see a simple demo and comparison between the `debouncedwidth` and `resize` event
open [demo/index.html](demo/index.html) in your browser and start resizing (width and height) to see it in action.

## Options

You can modify the threshold value globally once the script has been loaded:

```javascript
// default value in ms: 150
$.event.special.debouncedwidth.threshold = 250;
```
